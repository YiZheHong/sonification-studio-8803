This text file contains TODOs for the Highcharts sonification functionality,
as found during development of this app.
____________________________________________________________________________


- onEnd functions should receive a referene to the chart and the timeline
    (see usages of onEnd).

- Introduce a master volume. Should this be its own node (see next point)?
    (see sonification mappings for use case).

- Find a way to alter the master volume while playing.

- Introduce a chart.sonification.isPaused function or flag.
    (see play button functionality).

- Make Highcharts merge sonification array options with same deepMerge
    functionality as in this app. This would stop us from having to
    duplicate the default options here. See chart.update event in
    sonification.ts.

- Investigate why the duration time is so inaccurate.

- Should we even attempt to create the audio context before a gesture has
    been made? Not doing this would avoid a console warning.

- See if we can avoid audio lagging.
