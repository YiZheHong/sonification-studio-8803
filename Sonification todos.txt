This text file contains TODOs for the Highcharts sonification functionality,
as found during development of this app.
____________________________________________________________________________


- onEnd functions should receive a referene to the chart and the timeline
    (see usages of onEnd).

- Find a way to alter the master volume while playing.

- Introduce a chart.sonification.isPaused function or flag.
    (see play button functionality).

- Investigate why the duration time is so inaccurate.

- Should we even attempt to create the audio context before a gesture has
    been made? Not doing this would avoid a console warning.

- See if we can avoid audio lagging.
